# OOP-ASSIGNMENT2-saliha-qadeer-24i5521
This assignment focuses on implementing fundamental data structures and recursion concepts using C++. It is designed to help us understand how recursive algorithms and various data structures operate and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems efficiently.

The tasks involve writing recursive functions for pattern generation and array manipulation, developing singly and doubly linked lists to manage structured data such as geospatial and library information, and building a queue-based ticket booking system. Additionally, the assignment includes implementing stack structures using both linked lists and dynamic arrays, followed by an analysis of their time complexities to compare performance and efficiency.

Through these exercises, we apply key object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and operator overloading. The overall goal of the assignment is to integrate theoretical understanding of algorithms with hands-on coding practice, promoting a clear grasp of how fundamental data structures function and how to design modular, memory-efficient, and extensible software systems.
